Credits to DMC4 for the sheathe model and [Rabia Ã‡elik](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RabiaCelik/about-me) for the ribbon of the sheathe. It's from her mod adding [DMC3 Vergil over DLC Samuel](https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearrisingrevengeance/mods/627) (I was struggling to get its physics to work)
